        <p>This project is an exercise to investigate the DESIGN PRINCIPLES by employing algorithmic methods to determine the outcomes of the compositions. </p>

        <p>Objectives</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Create three levels of a game</li>
               <li>Use sketching to present and refine ideas</li>
               <li> Understand and apply design elements and principles to a composition</li>
               <li> Understand and apply design elements and principles to a composition</li>
               <li>Client makes some decisions! Hence the rolling of a dice - the client is the dice.</li>
           </ul>

           <p>We chose a theme for the game. The theme must stay consistent for all three levels of your game. The choices were Prehistoric, Western, Medieval or Future. We rolled a dice to values for the parts below. The algorithm of chance for each game level by rolling diceâ€”use the work sheet to keep track of the rolls. My game was about a rabbit who could time travel and the challenges it faced.</p>
